# Robotic-arm-assembly
To assemble all the pieces of the robotic arm we have to do four steps using any 3d softwares
1 - the first thing is to connect the waist with the base of the robot 
2 - the second thing is to connect the first arm with the circle hole of the weist
3 - the third is by connecting the second arm with the first arm
4 - last thing to do is to connect the gripper with the second arm
after doing all these steps you will assemble all the pieces making a robotic arm
